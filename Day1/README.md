# Day1 - Notes customization

## What is Cloud Computing?
- Pay as you to Go pricing
- Flexible infrastucture that can used on demand
- Highly Available (HA)
- Dynamic scaling
- Cheaper than procuring and maintaining own Servers

## Why do we need Cloud Computing?
- End-users can scale services to fit their needs, customize applications and access cloud services from anywhere with an internet connection
- Enterprise users can get applications to market quickly, without worrying about underlying infrastructure costs or maintenance
- Cloud services give enterprises a competitive advantage by providing the most innovative technology available
- Scalability
  - Cloud infrastructure scales on demand to support fluctuating workloads
- Storage options
  - Users can choose public, private, or hybrid storage offerings, depending on security needs and other considerations
- Control choices 
  - Organizations can determine their level of control with as-a-service options.  
      - Software as a service (SaaS)
      - Platform as a service (PaaS) and 
      - Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
- Tool selection
  - Users can select from a menu of prebuilt tools and features to build a solution that fits their specific needs
- Security features
  - Virtual private cloud, encryption, and API keys help keep data secure
- Efficiency
  - Accessibility
    - Cloud-based applications and data are accessible from virtually any internet-connected device
  - Speed to market
    - Developing in the cloud enables users to get their applications to market quickly
  - Data security
    - Hardware failures do not result in data loss because of networked backups
  - Savings on equipment
    - Cloud computing uses remote resources, saving organizations the cost of servers and other equipment
  - Pay structure
    - A “utility” pay structure means users only pay for the resources they use
- Strategic value
  - Streamlined work
    - Cloud service providers (CSPs) manage underlying infrastructure, enabling organizations to focus on application development and other priorities
  - Regular updates
    - Service providers regularly update offerings to give users the most up-to-date technology
  - Collaboration
    - Worldwide access means teams can collaborate from widespread locations
  - Competitive edge
    - Organizations can move more nimbly than competitors who must devote IT resources to managing infrastructure
    
## What is an Azure Region?
- you can think as a City like Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru

## What is an Azure Availability Zone?
- Within each Azure Region(City), there might be several Availability Zones
- Each Availability Zone represents one Data Center
- Eg: mumbai-west1a
      mumbai-west1b
      mumbai-west1c

## What is Data Centre
- a collection of many servers located in one Availability Zone under a Region
- Sever 1000s or even lakhs of Servers might be there in a single Availability Zone

## What is on-prem servers?
- On premise servers ( aka on-prem )
- Your company owned servers

## Different types of RAM
- UDIMM (Unbuffered Dual Inline Memory Module) - Used in Desktops
- SODIMM (Small Outline Dual Inline Memory Module) - Used in Laptops
- RDIMM (Registered Dual Inline Memory Module) - Used in Servers/Wokstations

## CPU Socket
- This allows installing and replacing the Central Processing Unit without soldering
- CPU Socket is where the Processor Integrated Chip is installed on the Motherboard
- A CPU socket uses a series of pins to connect a CPU's processor

Desktop and Laptops
  - usually have just one CPU Socket on a Motherboard
Workstations and Servers
  - may have one to many CPU Sockets on a Motherboard

## Integrated Chip (Processor)
- SCM ( Single Chip Module ) - One IC will has One Processor ( 1 Processor per Socket )
- MCM ( Multiple Chip Module ) - One IC will have many Processors ( 1 IC may have 2 ~ 8 Processors or more )

## Multiple Cores
1 Processor - may have many CPU Cores
1 Processor - may have 256 cores

MCM with 8 Processor ( Each Processor having 256 cores )
Per Socket = 8 x 256 Core = 2048 Cores

Server Motherboardss that has 8 Sockets
MCM ( 1 IC with 8 Processors )
Each Processor having 256 Cores 

8 x 256 * 8 = 16384 Cores

## What is Intel Hyperthreading/AMD SMT(Simultaneous Multi Threading) ?
- Each CPU Core has two or more Pipeline that can execute threads in parallel
- A CPU Core that supports Hyperthread/SMT can support 2 to 8 virtual cores
- In other words certain high-end CPU Cores support 8 virtual cores per physical core
- Most CPU Cores support 2 or 4 virtual cores per Physical CPU Core
- Assuming each Physical Core supports 4 Pipelines(vCores)
- If a Processor has 8 Physical Core, the total virtual cores is equivalent to 8 x 4 = 32 Virtual Cores
- Virtualization Softwares(Hypervisors) allocate virtual cores to Virtual Machines, hence if a laptop with 4 Physical Cores with Hyperthread is equivalent to 4 x 2 = 8 Virtual Cores, so technically 1 Host OS + 7 Guest OS(Virtual Machines) can run in parallel.

## What are the deciding factors that control the number of Virtual Machines that can be supported by a Single Server/Desktop/Laptop?
- RAM (Memory )
- HDD/SDD (Storage)
- Number of Cores

General Purpose Processors
1. AMD ( Invented 64 Bit Processors x86_64 Instructions )
 - 32 bit (AMD pays royalty for Intel's x86 Instructions set)
2. Intel (Invented 32 Bit Processors x86 Instructions )
 - 64 bit (Intel pays royalty for AMD's x64 Instruction set)

Virtualization Feature
AMD's virtualization feature
  - AMD-V (CPU Feature set)
Intel's Virtualization feature
  - VT-X (CPU Feature set)

## Subnet (IP Block - Address Range)
172.17.0.0/16 (IPV4 IP Address - 32 bit wide(4 bytes))
A.B.C.D/16(Bit are Fixed from Left - 172 and 17 are fixed)
16 - CIDR

172 - 1 byte (8 bit)
17 - 1 byte (8 bit)
0 - 1 byte (8 bit)
0 - 1 byte (8 bit)

172.17.0.0
172.17.0.1
172.17.0.2
...
172.17.0.255
172.17.1.0
172.17.1.1
...
172.17.1.255
...
172.17.255.255

= 255 x 255 = 65536 IP Addresses are there in 172.17.0.0/16

172.17.0.0/24 ( 255 IP Adresses )
172.17.0.0
172.17.0.1
...
172.17.0.255

IPV4(exiting IP format) and IPV6(New type of IP)

IP Address can be Dynamic or Static IP
- Public and Private IP

Virtual Network or Network
- Virtual networks are logically isolated from each other in Azure
- You can configure their IP address ranges, subnets, route tables, gateways, and security settings, much like a traditional network in your data center
- Virtual machines in the same virtual network can access each other by default
- Each Network can be divided into many Subnets

Subnet 
- Virtual Network can be divided into one or more Subnet ( small logical networks )
- A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your virtual network, which can be used to isolate virtual machines from each other or from the Internet.

## What is Private Cloud?
- Your on-prem data center

## What is Public Cloud?
- Azure
- AWS
- GCP

## Hybrdid Cloud
- Combination of your Private Cloud and Public Cloud

## OpenStack 
- you can manage virtual machine of different configurations on demand just like we can create VMs in Azure, AWS, GCP, etc.,
- Virtual Machines using the On-Prem Servers

## VMWare vSphare/vCenter (Bare Metal Hypervisor)

## What is Configuration Management Tools?
- Examples
  - Ansible, Puppet, Chef
- Infrastructure as a Code Tool
- Configuration Management Tools helps in automating software installation on a existing VMs, Physical Machine with OS
- For example, we can install a Webserver on a existing OS
- You can users on a existing OS

## What is a Provisioner tool?

- can automate creating Virtual Machines(OS), Container, installing OS on a Physical Machine
- Example
   - HashiCorp Vagrant, Docker 
  
## What is an Orchestration Platform?
- container management platform
- manages containerized application/microservices
- Example
  - Google Kubernetes
  - RedHat OpenShift
  - Docker SWARM

## What is Cloudformation?
- an Infrastructure as a Code (IaC) that helps in infrastructure automation in AWS
- it is a native technology developed by AWS to manage and automate infrastructure within AWS
- it doesn't support automating Infrastrucure in other cloud environments

## What is Terraform?
- Infrastructure as a Code(IaC) Tool
- primarily it helps in automating infrastructure (VMs, Storage, Load Balancers, etc )
- it is a cloud newtral Infrastrucure as a Code(IaC) tool that supports AWS, Azure, GCP, Local resources etc.,

You need a Virtual Machine with an CentOS 8 installed (Provisioner)
 - you could use Vagrant to provision Virtual Machine and automate CentOS 8 installation with SSH access based key pairs
 - Vagrant tools reads all the automation code from a script file called Vagrantfile ( ruby )
 - Developed by HashiCorp 

You wish to install Docker on that CentOS 8 Virtual Machine ( Configuration Management Tool)
- You could write ansible playbook to install Docker Container Engine

You wish to deploy a containerized Microservice ( Provisioner - IaC)
- You could use Docker

You wish to manage the microsevice (Orchestration Platform)
- Kubernetes/OpenShift to manage the containerized microservices

## What is Domanin Specific Language(DSL)?
- the language in which the automation code is written

Kubernetes/OpenShift
- it can be installed on your local Laptop/Desktop/Workstation/Server
- it can be installed in AWS/Azure/GCP on Virtual Machines on the public cloud
- Managed Services (SaaS - Model)
- In Azure
  - Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) - Managed Kubernetes Cluster (Orchestration Platform)
  - Installation of Kubernetes is taken care by Azure
- In AWS
  - Elatic Kubernetes Service (EKS) - Managed Kubernetes Cluster (Orchestration Platform)
- it provides an environment to run Microservices or Container applications
- it provides an environment for containerized application or microservice and make them High Available
- it is self-healing platform ( it know how to heal itself as well as microservice that are managed by them)
- it has inbuilt 

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Only the hardware is rented from Public Cloud (AWS,Azure,GCP,IBM Cloud, VMWare Cloud,Oracle Cloud,etc)
- OS System Licenses are managed by us

Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- We rent Hardware and Operating System from PUblic Cloud Vendors (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.,)
- We need install software like Oracle DB Server, Oracle Weblogic ourself either manually or in automated fashion

Software as a Service(SaaS)
- AWS EKS or Auzre AKS are examples

Infrastructure as a Code Tool
- helps in automation OS installation, softwares via source code
Examples:
1. Docker
2. Vagrant
3. Kubernetes/OpenShift/Docker SWARM
4. Ansible/Puppet/Chef/Salt(SaltStack)

- Installing kreuzwerker/docker v2.13.0...
- Installed kreuzwerker/docker v2.13.0 (self-signed, key ID 24E54F214569A8A5)

Partner and community providers are signed by their developers.
If you'd like to know more about provider signing, you can read about it here:
https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/plugins/signing.html

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
